## Basic Principles  - Red/Green/Refactor

1. Write the smallest possible test case that matches what we need to program.
2. Run the test and watch it fail. This gets you into thinking how to write only the code that makes it pass.
3. Write some code with the goal of making the test pass.
4. Run your test suite. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all tests pass.
5. Go back and refactor your new code, making it as simple and clear as possible while keeping the test suite green.

### you need think before you write any tests

### you donâ€™t need do much design at first 

### you should know when to move forward and when to go backward
